#' nanonext: NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen) Lightweight Messaging Library
#'
#' R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is a socket
#'     library implementing \sQuote{Scalability Protocols}, a reliable,
#'     high-performance standard for common communications patterns including
#'     publish/subscribe, request/reply and service discovery, over in-process,
#'     IPC, TCP, WebSocket and secure TLS transports. As its own threaded
#'     concurrency framework, provides a toolkit for asynchronous programming
#'     and distributed computing, with intuitive \sQuote{aio} objects which
#'     resolve automatically upon completion of asynchronous operations, and
#'     synchronisation primitives allowing R to wait upon events signalled by
#'     concurrent threads.
#'
#' @section Usage notes:
#'
#'     \pkg{nanonext} offers 2 equivalent interfaces: a functional interface,
#'     and an object-oriented interface.
#'
#'     The primary object in the functional interface is the Socket. Use
#'     \code{\link{socket}} to create a socket and dial or listen at an address.
#'     The socket is then passed as the first argument of subsequent actions
#'     such as \code{send()} or \code{recv()}.
#'
#'     The primary object in the object-oriented interface is the nano object.
#'     Use \code{\link{nano}} to create a nano object which encapsulates a
#'     Socket and Dialer/Listener. Methods such as \code{$send()} or
#'     \code{$recv()} can then be accessed directly from the object.

#'
#' @section Conceptual overview:
#'
#'     NNG presents a socket view of networking. A socket implements precisely
#'     one protocol, such as \sQuote{bus}, etc.
#'
#'     Each socket can be used to send and receive messages (if the protocol
#'     supports it, and implements the appropriate protocol semantics). For
#'     example, the \sQuote{sub} protocol automatically filters incoming
#'     messages to discard topics that have not been subscribed.
#'
#'     NNG sockets are message-oriented, and messages are either delivered
#'     wholly, or not at all. Partial delivery is not possible. Furthermore, NNG
#'     does not provide any other delivery or ordering guarantees: messages may
#'     be dropped or reordered (some protocols, such as \sQuote{req} may offer
#'     stronger guarantees by performing their own retry and validation schemes).
#'
#'     Each socket can have zero, one, or many endpoints, which are either
#'     listeners or dialers (a given socket may use listeners, dialers, or
#'     both). These endpoints provide access to underlying transports, such as
#'     TCP, etc.
#'
#'     Each endpoint is associated with a URL, which is a service address.
#'     For dialers, this is the service address that is contacted, whereas for
#'     listeners this is where new connections will be accepted.
