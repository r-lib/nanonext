R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is a socket library for reliable, high-performance messaging over in-process, IPC, TCP, WebSocket and secure TLS transports. Implements 'Scalability Protocols', a standard for common communications patterns including publish/subscribe, request/reply and service discovery.

As its own [threaded concurrency framework](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/articles/nanonext.html#async-and-concurrency), provides a toolkit for asynchronous programming and distributed computing. Intuitive 'aio' objects resolve automatically when asynchronous operations complete, and [synchronisation primitives](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/articles/nanonext.html#synchronisation-primitives) allow R to wait upon events signalled by concurrent threads.

Designed for performance and reliability, [`nanonext`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7903429) is a lightweight wrapper around the NNG C library, and is itself implemented almost entirely in C.

Provides the interface for code and processes to communicate with each other - [receive data generated in Python, perform analysis in R, and send results to a C++ program](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/articles/nanonext.html#cross-language-exchange) – on the same computer or across networks spanning the globe.

Implemented scalability protocols:

- Bus (mesh networks)
- Pair (two-way radio)
- Poly (one-to-one of many)
- Push/Pull (one-way pipeline)
- [Publisher/Subscriber](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/articles/nanonext.html#publisher-subscriber-model) (topics & broadcast)
- [Request/Reply](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/articles/nanonext.html#rpc-and-distributed-computing) (RPC)
- [Surveyor/Respondent](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/articles/nanonext.html#surveyor-respondent-model) (voting & service discovery)

Supported transports:

- inproc (intra-process)
- IPC (inter-process)
- TCP (IPv4 or IPv6)
- WebSocket
- [TLS](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/articles/nanonext.html#tls-secure-connections) (over TCP and WebSocket)

Development of the TLS implementation was generously supported by the

Web utilities:

- [ncurl](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/articles/nanonext.html#ncurl-async-http-client) - (async) http(s) client
- [stream](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/articles/nanonext.html#stream-websocket-client) - secure websockets client / generic low-level socket interface
- `messenger()` - console-based instant messaging with authentication

### Quick Start

`nanonext` offers 2 equivalent interfaces: a functional interface, and an object-oriented interface.

#### Functional Interface 

The primary object in the functional interface is the Socket. Use `socket()` to create a socket and dial or listen at an address. The socket is then passed as the first argument of subsequent actions such as `send()` or `recv()`.

*Example using Request/Reply (REQ/REP) protocol with inproc transport:* <br />
(The inproc transport uses zero-copy where possible for a much faster solution than alternatives)

Create sockets:

```{r}
#| label: example2
library(nanonext)

socket1 <- socket("req", listen = "inproc://nanonext")
socket2 <- socket("rep", dial = "inproc://nanonext")
```

Send message from 'socket1':

```{r}
#| label: send2
send(socket1, "hello world!")
```

Receive message using 'socket2':

```{r}
#| label: recv2
recv(socket2)
```

#### Object-oriented Interface

The primary object in the object-oriented interface is the nano object. Use `nano()` to create a nano object which encapsulates a Socket and Dialer/Listener. Methods such as `$send()` or `$recv()` can then be accessed directly from the object.

*Example using Pipeline (Push/Pull) protocol with TCP/IP transport:*

Create nano objects:

```{r}
#| label: example
library(nanonext)

nano1 <- nano("push", listen = "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")
nano2 <- nano("pull", dial = "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")
```

Send message from 'nano1':

```{r}
#| label: send
nano1$send("hello world!")
```

Receive message using 'nano2':

```{r}
#| label: recv
nano2$recv()
```

### Vignette

Please refer to the [nanonext vignette](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/articles/nanonext.html) for full package functionality.

This may be accessed within R by:

```{r}
#| label: vignette
#| eval: false
vignette("nanonext", package = "nanonext")
```

### Installation

Install the latest release from CRAN:

```{r}
#| label: cran
#| eval: false
install.packages("nanonext")
```

Or the current development version from R-universe:

```{r}
#| label: universe
#| eval: false
install.packages("nanonext", repos = "https://r-lib.r-universe.dev")
```

### Building from Source

#### Linux / Mac / Solaris

Installation from source requires 'libnng' >= v1.9.0 and 'libmbedtls' >= 2.5.0 (suitable installations are automatically detected), or else 'cmake' to compile 'libnng' v1.10.2 pre-release and 'libmbedtls' v3.6.2 included within the package sources.

**It is recommended for optimal performance and stability to let the package automatically compile bundled versions of 'libmbedtls' and 'libnng' during installation.** To ensure the libraries are compiled from source even if system installations are present, set the `NANONEXT_LIBS` environment variable prior to installation e.g. by `Sys.setenv(NANONEXT_LIBS = 1)`.

As system libraries, 'libnng' is available as libnng-dev (deb) or nng-devel (rpm), and 'libmbedtls' as libmbedtls-dev (deb) or libmbedtls-devel (rpm). The `INCLUDE_DIR` and `LIB_DIR` environment variables may be set prior to package installation to specify a custom location for 'libmbedtls' or 'libnng' other than the standard filesystem locations.

*Additional requirements for Solaris: (i) the 'xz' package - available on OpenCSW, and (ii) a more recent version of 'cmake' than available on OpenCSW - refer to the 'cmake' website for the latest source file.*

#### Windows

On Windows, 'libnng' v1.10.2 pre-release and 'libmbedtls' v3.6.2 will be compiled from the package sources during installation and hence requires the 'Rtools' toolchain.

For R >= 4.2 using the 'Rtools42' or newer toolchains, the prerequisite 'cmake' is included. For previous R versions using 'Rtools40' or earlier, it may be necessary to separately install a version of 'cmake' in Windows and ensure that it is added to your system's `PATH`.

### Acknowledgements and Links

We would like to acknowledge in particular:

- [Garrett D'Amore](https://github.com/gdamore), author of the NNG library, for generous advice and for implementing a feature request specifically for a more efficient 'aio' implementation in `nanonext`.
- The [R Consortium](https://r-consortium.org/) for funding the development of the secure TLS capabilities in the package, and [Henrik Bengtsson](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson) and [Will Landau](https://github.com/wlandau/)'s roles in making this possible.
- [Joe Cheng](https://github.com/jcheng5/) for prototyping the integration of `nanonext` with `later` to support the next generation of completely event-driven 'promises'.
- [Luke Tierney](https://github.com/ltierney/) (R Core) and [Mike Cheng](https://github.com/coolbutuseless) for meticulous documentation of the R serialization mechanism, which led to the package's own implementation of a low-level interface to R serialization.
- [Jeroen Ooms](https://github.com/jeroen) - for his 'Anticonf (tm)' configure script, on which our original 'configure' was based, although much modified since.
