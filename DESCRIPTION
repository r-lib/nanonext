Description: R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ.
    A toolkit for messaging, concurrency and the web. High-performance
    socket messaging over in-process, IPC, TCP, WebSocket and secure TLS
    transports implements 'Scalability Protocols', a standard for common
    communications patterns including publish/subscribe, request/reply and
    survey. A threaded concurrency framework with intuitive 'aio' objects
    that resolve automatically upon completion of asynchronous operations,
    and synchronisation primitives that allow R to wait on events
    signalled by concurrent threads. A unified HTTP server hosting REST
    endpoints, WebSocket connections and streaming on a single port, with
    a built-in HTTP client.
