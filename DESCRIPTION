Description: R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ.
    NNG is a socket library for reliable, high-performance messaging over
    in-process, IPC, TCP, WebSocket and secure TLS transports. Implements
    'Scalability Protocols', a standard for common communications patterns
    including publish/subscribe, request/reply and service discovery. As
    its own threaded concurrency framework, provides a toolkit for
    asynchronous programming and distributed computing. Intuitive 'aio'
    objects resolve automatically when asynchronous operations complete,
    and synchronisation primitives allow R to wait upon events signalled
    by concurrent threads.
