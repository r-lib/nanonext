Title: NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen) Lightweight Messaging Library
Version: 1.5.2.9001
Description: R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is
    a socket library for reliable, high-performance messaging over in-process,
    IPC, TCP, WebSocket and secure TLS transports. Implements 'Scalability
    Protocols', a standard for common communications patterns including
    publish/subscribe, request/reply and service discovery. As its own threaded
    concurrency framework, provides a toolkit for asynchronous programming and
    distributed computing. Intuitive 'aio' objects resolve automatically when
    asynchronous operations complete, and synchronisation primitives allow R to
    wait upon events signalled by concurrent threads.
