Title: NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen) Lightweight Messaging Library
Version: 1.3.2.9002
Description: R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is
    a socket library implementing 'Scalability Protocols', a reliable,
    high-performance standard for common communications patterns including
    publish/subscribe, request/reply and service discovery, over in-process,
    IPC, TCP, WebSocket and secure TLS transports. As its own threaded
    concurrency framework, provides a toolkit for asynchronous programming and
    distributed computing, with intuitive 'aio' objects which resolve
    automatically upon completion of asynchronous operations, and
    synchronisation primitives allowing R to wait upon events signalled by
    concurrent threads.
