}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a Listener or Dialer.}

\item{...}{not used.}

\item{async}{[default TRUE] (applicable to Dialers only) logical flag
whether the connection attempt, including any name resolution, is to be
made asynchronously. This behaviour is more resilient, but also generally
makes diagnosing failures somewhat more difficult. If FALSE, failure, such
as if the connection is refused, will be returned immediately, and no
further action will be taken.}

\value{
Invisibly, an integer exit code (zero on success).
