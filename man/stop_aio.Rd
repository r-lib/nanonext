\title{Stop Asynchronous Aio Operation}
\usage{
stop_aio(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an Aio or list of Aios (objects of class \sQuote{sendAio},
\sQuote{recvAio} or \sQuote{ncurlAio}).}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL.
}
\description{
Stop an asynchronous Aio operation, or a list of Aio operations.
}
\details{
Stops the asynchronous I/O operation associated with Aio \code{x} by aborting, and
then waits for it to complete or to be completely aborted, and for the
callback associated with the Aio to have completed executing. If successful,
the Aio will resolve to an \sQuote{errorValue} 20 (Operation canceled).

Note this function operates silently and does not error even if \code{x} is not an
active Aio, always returning invisible NULL.
