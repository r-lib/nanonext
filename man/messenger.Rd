\item{auth}{[default NULL] an R object (possessed by both parties) which

\description{
Multi-threaded, console-based, 2-way instant messaging system with
authentication, based on NNG scalability protocols.
}
\note{
The authentication protocol is an experimental proof of concept which
is not secure, and should not be used for critical applications.
}
\section{Usage}{


Type outgoing messages and hit return to send.

The timestamps of outgoing messages are prefixed by \code{>} and that of
incoming messages by \code{<}.

\verb{:q} is the command to quit.

Both parties must supply the same argument for \code{auth}, otherwise the party
trying to connect will receive an \sQuote{authentication error} and be
immediately disconnected.
